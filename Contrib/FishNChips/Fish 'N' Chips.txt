RCA1802 CPU emulation based on datasheet released by Intersil, 1997. RCA1861
"Pixie" videochip emulation based on datasheet by RCA. RCA COSMAC VIP emulation
mostly based on the official manual, and program disassemblies by Lee A. Hart
(Monitor ROM) and Josh Bensadon (CHIP-8/CHIP-8X interpreters).
CHIP-8/SCHIP interpreter mostly based on technical documentation by David Winter,

Compiled with GCC 4.2.3, using MinGW, http://www.mingw.org/

Executable bundled with CHIP-8 Rush Hour and SCHIP Sokoban (C) hap 2006. These
are adaptations of original puzzlegames by Hiroyuki Imabayashi/Thinking Rabbit,
and Nobuyuki Yoshigahara "Nob"/ThinkFun.

go ahead, as long as you credit me, and your project is open source too.



== What? ==

The COSMAC VIP is a computer from 1977 with a 1802 CPU running at 1.7609MHz
addressing up to 4KB of RAM, a 1861 "Pixie" videochip capable of displaying
monochrome graphics at a resolution up to 64*128, and a keypad with 16 keys
(0-F). Don't ask me what COSMAC stands for, in the 70s it probably sounded
really cool to young guys hoping for a job at NASA. VIP stands for Video
Interface Processor. CHIP-8 is a low level interpreted programming language
designed for this computer, CHIP-8X is an extension to CHIP-8. SCHIP is another
extension to CHIP-8, but designed for HP calculators instead.

Fish 'N' Chips, a hybrid COSMAC VIP emulator/SCHIP interpreter, is meant to run
CHIP-8, CHIP-8X, and SCHIP programs, that are freely available on the internet.
As it's not very easy to find these programs, 2 games by me have been included
with the executable. It should also be possible to run programs designed for
the COSMAC VIP by setting the start address at 0, though the tape interface
hasn't been emulated.

It's up to you to pick the right mode (VIP CHIP-8/VIP CHIP-8X/SCHIP). Basically,
SCHIP programs will only run in SCHIP mode, and CHIP-8X programs will only run
in VIP CHIP-8X mode. CHIP-8 programs can be run in VIP CHIP-8 and SCHIP modes.
These two interpret programs slightly differently, so one might work in SCHIP
mode while it won't in VIP CHIP-8 mode and vice versa.

A list of known differences:

		VIP CHIP-8 (emulated)		SCHIP (interpreted)

timing:		An instruction takes a		Each instruction takes 1 cycle,
		variable amount of cycles, up  	speed can be changed by user.
		to an entire frame when
		drawing a sprite.
memory:		~3232 bytes available.		3584 bytes available.
stack:		12 levels. 			16 levels, circular.
host code:	Hybrid CHIP-8/1802 programs 	Host is the PC, hybrid programs

op 8XY6/8XYE*1:	The value from VY gets shifted,	Y is ignored.
		the result is stored into VX.
op FX55/FX65*2:	When done, I=I+X+1.		I is left unchanged.
op FX0A*3:	Wait for key release, and beep	Wait for keypress.

*3: CHIP-8 wait for keypress instruction



== How? ==

I bet you can't wait playing those state of the art CHIP-8 games you heard
everyone talking about. They can be loaded by using the menu, the commandline,
or by dragging-dropping a file onto the main window/executable. The GUI is
simple and self-explanatory. Settings are saved to the Windows registry after
exit, "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Fish 'N' Chips emulator\" to be exact.

Controls reference:

 CHIP:			PC:
1 2 3 C		1 2 3 4		7 8 9 0
4 5 6 D		Q W E R		U I O P
7 8 9 E		A S D F		J K L ;
A 0 B F		Z X C V		M , . /

or just 0-F after picking the keypad 'on character' option.

F1:  decrease SCHIP speed
F2:  increase SCHIP speed
F3:  soft machine reset
F4:  hard machine reset (reload)
F5:  change mode (any open program will be reopened at default start address)
F6:  save state in memory (will be lost after hard reset)
F7:  load state from memory
F8:  toggle SCHIP cheat (sprite collision detection)
F9:  toggle sound
F10: menu (standard key)
F11: toggle inverted colours
F12: random colours

(Alt+F4: exit)

CHIP-8 Rush Hour: Use WSAD to move, Z to accept/hold to slide, 1 to cancel.
     The object of this game is to slide out the arrow block(s).
SCHIP Sokoban: Use WSAD to move, Z to accept/undo, hold X to restart.
     The object of Sokoban is to push all boxes to their destination.

These games, including documentation and source code, can also be downloaded
from my homepage ( http://tsk-tsk.net/ ).



== Newest Changes ==

Refer to history.txt for the complete list.

18-05-07: 2.1
In my opinion, this application is done. Don't expect any big updates like the
December 2006 release.

- changed icon background to transparant, and added a 48*48 icon
- added a help window, and improved the about window
- fixed frame timing on laptops that change their CPU clock speed to save power
  (untested)
- small speedup by changing source struct alignment
- centered application window on startup
- removed exit shortcut (Escape key), Alt+F4 is fine

29-07-07: 2.1.1
- a few minor changes
- included C8 and SC icons, for use with manual file association

03-09-07: 2.1.2
- fixed possible frame timing problem on dual core processors
- redid version numbering, like the way it was before 13-02-05: X.Y.Z, where
  X increment=complete rewrite, Y inc=normal release, Z inc=minor release

21-04-08: 2.1.3
- updated the included Rush Hour game
- fixed really stupid timing calculation bug that caused the emulator to fail
  completely on some computers

13-07-08: 2.1.4
The main reason for this minor release is because my homepage moved to a new
location

- various small fixes (not just the remark above)

05-09-08: 2.1.5

- fixed possible crash on Windows Vista
