This list is ordered chronologically, so if you want to see the newest changes,
you'll have to scroll alllllll the way down. Between 13-02-05 and 03-09-07,
version numbers were 1.x, with x incrementing every release.


23-01-05: 1.0
Everything's new (started development on 08-01-05)

- complete CHIP-8 and SCHIP emulation/interpretation, with variable CPU speed
- standard GUI
- save state support

25-01-05: 1.0.1
- a few optimisations
- start address selector, seems to be useless, but I'll keep it in. I thought
  it would make the CHIP-8 bootrom work... guess not
- ROM loading bugfix: program counter was reset too late

28-01-05: 1.0.2
- some more optimisations
- a couple of source code cleanups
- renamed ROMs to clearer names
- added CHIP-8 ROMs: 15puzzle2, C8pic, Cave (most fun of this bunch), Chip8Boot
  (won't work), Filter, Guess2, IBM, Invaders2, Maze2, Pong3, Rocket, Rocket2,
  Tapeworm, X-Mirror (won't work). thanks to newsdee for most of these
- added SCHIP ROM: Emutest, by me. it tests the timer, half-line scrolling, and
  8*16 sprite mode

31-01-05: 1.0.3
- when will the optimisations stop?
- able to choose different random functions: AND or modulo
- nomore UPX (compressed executable), useless for such a small executable

06-02-05: 1.0.4
- colours more faithful to the HP48
- some unimportant fixes

13-02-05: 1.0.5
- changed version numbering, thus evily rewrote the history too like in 1984
- I don't keep track of every small change, but there must have been some

19-02-05: 1.0.6
- fixed potential crash when loading from commandline
- compiled with newer version of gcc/mingw

22-02-05: 1.0.7
- you can now change colours, also randomly (F9)
- ...and overclock the cpu speed*1000, but useless for games using the timer

23-02-05: 1.0.8
- nightly typos make the world go around


29-05-05: 1.1
- sound (from pc speaker, i'm too lazy to add directsound to this silly emu)

29-05-05: 1.1.1
- I (quickly) went ahead and added directsound sound anyway
- the host flags are not forgotten anymore, but saved to flags.sav


03-06-05: 1.2
- you can rewind gameplay for up to about 20 seconds (F6), quite the same like
  in Prince of Persia: Sands of Time
- actually put some help into the help window, whoa
- added a BMP viewer ROM, by yours truly. works with monochrome BMPs only, of
  course. put the BMP data (headerless) at offset $30. change offset $0 $00ff
  to $1202 for CHIP-8.

05-06-05: 1.2.1
- fixed sound crackling while rewinding

21-06-05: 1.2.2
- fixed probable current directory find bug

10-07-05: 1.2.3
- added the Fish 'N' Chips logo ROM, and made it a splash screen (fun place to
  be for a fish)

26-10-05: 1.2.4
- urm, forgot to free state rewind memory on exit


06-01-06: 1.3
Hehe, it's been almost a year since I've started with this emulator.

- cleaned up a bit of source code (renamed standard typedefs to prevent
  collision with Windows typedefs, removed support for binary, merged font.h
  with fishie.h to data.h, shortcuts for commonly used functions, version info)
- changed some default settings (higher CPU speed, disabled wrapping, different
  colours, larger window)
- removed the ROMs from the release, even though they're freeware
- the loaded ROM filename is now shown in the titlebar
- timing should be more accurate
- added a $100 start address option, for Boot-128 (so the start address
  selector added in 1.0.1 was useful after all)
- moved font data to the $000-$0FF region

15-02-06: 1.3.1
- fixed scrolling to the right, where the leftmost pixels scrolled to the left
  (out of the screen) instead
- ROMs can now also be opened by dragging/dropping one onto the window


08-04-06: 1.4
- fixed carry maths in opcodes, also removed the carry hack for Spacefight
  (that game doesn't work right)
- fixed possible overflows in some opcodes, and the stack
- fixed sound hanging sometimes when a game quit
- fixed the sound being 1 cycle too short, causing the shortest possible beep
  to be silent
- changed the beeper sound a bit
- corrected the flags from 16 to 8 bytes
- fixed the 'wait for keypress' opcode, where it went through if a key was held
  down, and not only when pressed
- moved some GUI options into a 'Hacks' section

08-04-06: 1.4.1
bleh, I hate finding bugs right after a new version..

- fixed the 'wait for keypress' opcode, again (fix was broken in 1.4)
- fixed some more possible overflows
- fixed rewinding when the rewind buffer is empty

08-06-06: 1.4.2
- added an option to increment the index register on memory opcodes, necessary
  for some older games
- hardly added support for CHIP-8X


29-12-06: 2.0
- source: lots of refactoring, almost everything has been rewritten
- added accurate RCA COSMAC VIP emulation with built-in CHIP-8 and CHIP-8X
  modes, the SCHIP interpreter is separate from this
- removed support for rewind
- SCHIP: removed CHIP-8X support (emulated now), removed modulo random hack,
  removed increment i hack, and added a hack to clear the HP48 flags
- SCHIP: speed is visible on the titlebar
- if emulation/interpretation has stopped, it's visible on the titlebar
  instead of a messagebox
- shortened titlebar title to FNC
- settings/flags are saved to the registry instead of an external file
- added hard reset
- added aspect ratio selection
- frame timing is more accurate
- added a sleep option to prevent heavy cpu usage (it affects frame timing
  accuracy)
- input: switched to DirectInput, added a 'shadow' keypad, and added an option
  to set keys on character instead of on location
- changed hotkey layout a bit
- moved start address selection to the open dialog
- executable is now bundled with 2 games by me, Sokoban and Rush Hour
- rewrote documentation


18-05-07: 2.1
In my opinion, this application is done. Don't expect any big updates like the
December 2006 release.

- changed icon background to transparant, and added a 48*48 icon
- added a help window, and improved the about window
- fixed frame timing on laptops that change their CPU clock speed to save power
  (untested)
- small speedup by changing source struct alignment
- centered application window on startup
- removed exit shortcut (Escape key), Alt+F4 is fine

29-07-07: 2.1.1
- a few minor changes
- included C8 and SC icons, for use with manual file association

03-09-07: 2.1.2
- fixed possible frame timing problem on dual core processors
- redid version numbering, like the way it was before 13-02-05: X.Y.Z, where
  X increment=complete rewrite, Y inc=normal release, Z inc=minor release

21-04-08: 2.1.3
- updated the included Rush Hour game
- fixed really stupid timing calculation bug that caused the emulator to fail
  completely on some computers

13-07-08: 2.1.4
The main reason for this minor release is because my homepage moved to a new
location

- various small fixes (not just the remark above)

05-09-08: 2.1.5

- fixed possible crash on Windows Vista
